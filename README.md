### Dice 🎲
This is a dice betting game. The player is initially given $500. (Mars Dollars™, for copyright reasons)
They then make a wager, the amount they want to bet, and then make a guess of what the dice will roll.
Two dice are rolled three times. For each roll, the total of the two are added.
If the player's guess matches the total on the…
* 1st roll, the player wins 2 times their wager.
* 2nd roll, the player wins 1½ times their wager.
* 3rd roll, the player wins their wager.

Players cannot wager more than they have in the bank, and they must guess between 2 & 12, 
the possible total of 2 6-sided dice. If the player's bank reaches $0, they start over.
