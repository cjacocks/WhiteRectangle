    ⬜4️⃣⬜3️⃣
A game like Simon Says™ where the player must remember the sequence of numbers in
the legendary White Triangle Grid™.

### Rock Paper Scissors
    📜 covers 🪨
    🪨 crushes ✂️
    ✂️ cuts 📜
This is like Rock Paper Scissors™ but not trademarked.

### Dice 🎲
This is a dice betting game. The player is initially given $500. (Mars Dollars™, for copyright reasons)
They then make a wager, the amount they want to bet, and then make a guess of what the dice will roll.
Two dice are rolled three times.
* 1st roll, you win 2x your wager.
* 2nd roll, you win 1½x your wager.
* 3rd roll, you win your wager.
You cannot wager more than you have in the bank, and you must guess between 2 & 12, 
the possible totals of 2 dice. If the player's bank reaches $0, they start over.
